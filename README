Source File Layout
------------------
The src/ directory contains the firmware source files. src/peripherals/ contains
modules providing high-level interfaces to on-chip peripherals, such as the
I2C and SPI systems. src/board/ contains modules providing high-level
interfaces to other ICs on the PCB, such as the IMU and bluetooth controller.
